# Zero-Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) Structure Calculator
This Python program calculates the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) structure of a star, with the Sun as an example. The code is designed to be flexible and can be used to model low-mass stars as well. The program requires an initial guess/conditions for the star's structure.

## Features
1. Calculates the ZAMS structure of a star
2. Flexible and customizable for different stellar masses
3. Provides insights into the internal structure and properties of stars
4. Useful for studying low-mass stars
5. Useful for direct comparison with MESA stellar modeling package

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Installation
Clone the GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/swethasnkr/StellarModelingCalculation.git
